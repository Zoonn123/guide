An arithmetic sequence, or arithmetic progression, is a sequence of numbers where the difference between each consecutive number is the same.

If n is the placement of some term in the sequence (e.g. 1, 2, 3...), d is the difference between each consecutive term, k is the first the placement of the first known term of the sequence (e.g. if you know the first term, then k = 1), a<sub>k</sub> is the value of the k<sup>th</sup> term in the sequence (i.e. the value at term number k), and a<sub>n</sub> is the value of the n<sup>th</sup> term in the sequence (i.e. the value at term number n), then the equation for an arithmetic sequence is this<sup>1</sup>:

a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>k</sub> + d(n - k)
